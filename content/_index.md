# OPTIMIZE COST WITH LAMBDA

#### Overview

In an AWS environment, Amazon EC2 is one of the most widely used services—and also a major source of cost if not managed effectively. The **“Optimize EC2 Cost with Lambda”** workshop is designed to help you automate EC2 cost management by using AWS Lambda to shut down EC2 instances when they are not needed—such as outside business hours.

- Tag EC2 instances to identify which ones should be optimized.
