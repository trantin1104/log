	"content": "INTRODUCTION When using AWS cloud infrastructure, many organizations face resource wastage, especially with EC2 instances running unnecessarily outside of working hours. Failing to monitor and optimize these instances can lead to significant operational costs.\nWorkshop Objective The ‚ÄúOptimize EC2 Cost with Lambda‚Äù workshop is designed to help users:\nAutomate starting/stopping EC2 instances based on schedules or conditions. Use AWS Lambda to manage EC2 resources without provisioning or managing servers (serverless). Minimize cloud infrastructure costs through simple and reusable automation steps. üí° AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.\n"

	"content": "OPTIMIZE COST WITH LAMBDA Overview In an AWS environment, Amazon EC2 is one of the most widely used services‚Äîand also a major source of cost if not managed effectively. The ‚ÄúOptimize EC2 Cost with Lambda‚Äù workshop is designed to help you automate EC2 cost management by using AWS Lambda to shut down EC2 instances when they are not needed‚Äîsuch as outside business hours.\nThrough this workshop, you will learn how to:\nTag EC2 instances to identify which ones should be optimized. Create an IAM Role that allows Lambda to control EC2. Write a Lambda function to automatically start/stop EC2 instances based on a schedule. Verify the results and clean up resources. Objectives This workshop helps participants:\nUnderstand how to integrate Lambda with EC2. Optimize EC2 usage costs. Increase automation in cloud infrastructure operations. Requirements To complete this workshop, you‚Äôll need:\nAn AWS account with AdministratorAccess permissions. Basic knowledge of EC2, IAM, and Lambda. A web browser and stable internet connection. Workshop Modules Introduction Setup Requirements Create Tag For Instances Create IAM Role for Lambda Create Lambda Function Verify Results Clean Up Resources "
